## Project Description 
<br><br/>

## Online Store

<br><br/>
Our Starbucks implementation consists of a React front-end which is connected through REST API to the H2 and MySQL databases. The front end design consists of a navigation header, the body based on different screens, and the footer.

As we can see, we have a landing home with a beautiful front-end which can be updated to the latest deals and promotions. The header navigation routes between pages and sign in, sign buttons are in-place for authentication.

Take a look at our menu!
