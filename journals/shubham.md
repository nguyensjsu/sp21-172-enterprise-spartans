This week we had a team meeting where we discussed different areas to work. We went over the project requirements and allocated tasks to work on over the next week. I had a few challenges in understanding the different aspects needed for this project. We went over the business requirements for Starbucks project. I set up the cards to track our progress on the GitHub. I also created a project structure on GitHub to keep our files orgranized. I currently re-worked on the starbucks api from the lab 6 and pushed that to Github for reference. Over the next week, I will be working on the implementation of the Cashier's app.
