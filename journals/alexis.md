This week we held a team meeting to discuss our roles in the project. I was tasked to work on the online storefront for the project. I'm currently going over React and Node.js. So far, I have not committed any code to the project yet, but I should be able to in time for the next check-in. One challenge I know will come up is trying to smoothly integrate the frontend with the rest of the project, but I plan to thoroughly review the code of my peers so I can make as few mistakes as possible. Over the next week, I will attempt to create functional webpages that interact with the project key functions.
