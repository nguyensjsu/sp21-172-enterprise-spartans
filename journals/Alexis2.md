This week, I focused on the implementation of the front-end. I spent a lot of time reading through the code of my teammates and tried to plan out how I would implement different web page functionalities based on their implementations. One problem that I am currently dealing with is a problem with my IDE's Github configuration. I am currently unable to push and commit properly to Github, so I'm in the process of resolving that so I can push my work to Github. It's a major setback, but it's definitely fixable. In the worst case scenario, I'll do a clean install on my second machine and redo my configurations there.
